## External Resources ("Special thanks to...")

For this project, the following external resources were used:

* **[Architect-UI](https://architectui.com/#/) admin panel template**
    
    This template is based on the [Bootstrap 4 CSS and JavaScript framework](https://getbootstrap.com)
    and comes  with the ["Stroke Icons 7"](https://themes-pixeden.com/font-demos/7-stroke/) 
    icons font embedded in it.
    
* **[Stroke Icons 7 (Pe-7s)](https://themes-pixeden.com/font-demos/7-stroke/) icons pack**

    This icons pack/font is a series of iOS 7 inspired vector icons in a custom@font-face
    icon font that can be styled dynamically using CSS. Those retina ready icons have a
    very modern style that will beautifully complement any project.
